!site diminution parameters: fmax, kappa_0, dkappadmag, amagkref
! (NOTE: fmax=0.0 or kappa_0=0.0 => fmax or kappa are not used.  I included this
!  to prevent the inadvertent use of both fmax and kappa to control the diminution
!  of high-frequency motion (it would be very unusual to use both parameters
!  together.  Also note that if do not want to use kappa, dkappadmag must also
!  be set to 0.0).

!window params: iwind(0=box,1=exp), taper(<1), eps_w, eta_w, f_tb2te, f_te_xtnd
! (see SMSIM manual for the meaning of the parameters)
! As of 11/25/11, I will not use the shape parameters, using the default
! parameters in the call to wind2 instead.  The only parameters I use as of this
! date are iwind and taper.
! BUT: placeholders must be included for eps_w, eta_w, f_tb2te, f_te_xtnd, because some day
! they may be used.

!timing stuff: dur_fctr, dt, tshift, seed, nsims, iran_type (0=normal;1=uniform)
! NOTE: these are the SMSIM parameters, but for now (11/25/11) I will read and use
! the current EXSIM parameters, as given in the next uncommented line.
! The reason not to change to the SMSIM parameters is that I do not have the time to
! make sure that the program is revised correctly.   The tpadl and tpadt params do not
! automatically account for magnitude, and if the values are not changed each time amag
! is changed they may be unnecessarily long for small events and too short for large 
! events.  It is up to the user to specify adequate values (these values are adjusted
! to appropriate sizes automatically in SMSIM).

! SOURCE PARAMETERS:

!MW, Stress
  7.0 140.0    	
!lat and lon of corner on upper edge of fault
  0.0 0.0  
!strike,dip, depth of corner on upper edge of fault
  0.0 50.0 2.0            	
!fault type (S=strikeslip; R=reverse; N=normal; U=undifferentiated) 
! (Only used if Wells and Coppersmith is used to obtain FL and FW).
  R                               
!fault length and width, dl, dw, stress_ref
!Note: Force program to use Wells and Coppersmith (WC) for FL and/or FW if
! either entry = 0.0.
! If Wells and Coppersmith are used to obtain FL and/or FW, the WC values are
! modified to account for the scaling implied by differences in the stress
! specified above and a stress that is assumed to be valid for the generic WC
! relations; this stress is stress_ref. The value of 70 bars is an educated
! guess for stress_ref, but it is not based on a quantitative analysis.
! The WC values of FL and/or FW are multiplied by the factor
! (stress_ref/stress)^(1/3).
! Note that four entries on the following line are needed as placeholders,
! even if not used)

! PARAMETERS RELATED TO PATH AND SITE:
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!Name of crustal amplification file:
!This file contains amplifications, usually without any attenuation, from the source to 
!near the surface.  It is often computed using the square-root-impedance method
!(see Boore, D. M. (2013). The uses and limitations of the square-root impedance method for 
!computing site amplification, Bull. Seismol. Soc. Am. 103, 2356--2368), as implemented
!in the programs site_amp or site_amp_batch, available from my SMSIM software package.
!The attenuation is usually included through the kappa_0 parameter specified in the
!!site diminution parameters: fmax, kappa_0, dkappadmag, amagkref line above
  crustal_amps_sample.txt
!Name of site amplification file:
!This file allows additional site response to be included, if desired (I have never used it;
!this file has been carried over from D. Motazedian's original version of EXSIM).  
!For example, it could include resonant near-surface amplification and attenuation.

! PARAMETERS RELATED TO COMPUTATIONS OF AVERAGES:
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------
!
!iflagfas_avg (1=arithmetic, 2=geometric, 3=rms: USE 3!)
  3                               
!iflagpsa_avg_over_sims (1=arithmetic: USE 1!, 2=geometric, 3=rms)
! NOTE on 22 November 2011.  I used to advise using the geometric mean, but in
! the course of working on a paper with Eric Thompson on RV calculations in SMSIM
! I found that my TD calculations have used geoemtric averages until 03 August 1994,
! when I switched to arithmetic averages, apparently as a result of a recommendation
! by Bill Joyner.
  1                               
!iflagpsa_avg_over_hypos (1=arithmetic, 2=geometric, 3=rms)
! The program first computes the average ground-motion intensity measure over the number
! of simulations for a given hypocenter, and then computes an average of these over the
! hypocenters.  There might some justification to use a geometric mean for this.

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------
! PARAMETERS RELATED TO THE SITES AT WHICH MOTIONS ARE COMPUTED:
! Put this last for convenience in editing the params file.  For example, the site list 
! can be very long, but by inserting "stop" in the list it is easy to select a small subset 
! of site at which motions will be computed.

!  if site coord flag = 3 and siteLocation(1) = 0, redefine 
!                         siteLocation(1) = 0 to be the midpoint of the 
!                         top edge of the fault (so that the sites will be
!                         along a line normal to the midpoint)
!  if site coord flag = 3 and siteLocation(2) = 0, redefine
!                         siteLocation(1) = 0 to be the far end of the fault,
!                         so that the sites are along a line along the
