# stoexsim

A stochastic implementation of EXSIM

## Introduction

This repo is a wrapper for the implementation of the EXSIM (stochasict finite-fault model). Particularly, we provide extra capabilities in modeling some key parameters as random variables to account for variability.

## Usage

```shell
$ "mechanism=N;depth=10;Mw=6.5;Repi=10; csh do_exsim.csh $mechanism $depth $Mw $Repi"
```
